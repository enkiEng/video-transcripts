## Summary

Chris Norlund discusses the emerging concerns about an AI bubble, focusing on Michael Burry's (famous from "The Big Short") $912 million short position against Nvidia and Palantir. The video highlights Palantir CEO Alex Karp's emotional TV appearance defending his company against short sellers, despite the stock's 624 P/E ratio. The video draws parallels to past market bubbles, noting Warren Buffett's record cash position, widespread tech layoffs, and Bitcoin's decline below $100,000. Norlund suggests multiple indicators point to a market top, including retail investor enthusiasm and circular financing among AI companies.

## Key Points
- Michael Burry betting $912M against Nvidia and Palantir
- Palantir's P/E ratio at 624 (potentially 30-40x overvalued)
- CEO Alex Karp's emotional defense on national TV
- Warren Buffett sitting on record cash pile ($6B recently sold)
- Major tech companies laying off workers (IBM, Walmart, Amazon, Target, UPS)
- Bitcoin fell below $100,000
- Signs of circular financing among AI companies
- Schiller P/E ratio at 40 (historically high valuation)

## Transcript

So, the tech billionaire bros are in
full panic today as the markets are
crashing and the bubble is getting
called out. Check out this headline
then. Big short star Michael Bur's $1
billion bet against tech giants shakes
the market. And if you're curious, he
bet against uh Nvidia and Palanteer. If
you don't know Michael Bur, he's the guy
who was made famous in the big short
movie. He bet against the housing market
and was right during the great financial
crisis and now is betting against the AI
bubble. And what you're gonna see is
really funny. It's the CEO of Palunteer,
right? One of these companies is going
to go on TV and basically cry cry cry.
Have a listen to this.
>> As far as I can tell, the two companies
he's shorting are the ones making all
the money, which is super weird. Like
the idea that chips and is what you want
to short is bat crazy. So, he's going on
TV swearing like, "Oh, if you bet
against me, you crazy, bro." And, uh,
you know, this guy's worth nearly $18
billion and he's crying on TV. Um, I get
it, though, right? Look at this. His
stock went down about nine almost 10% in
one day. And if you look at the PE ratio
of this thing, 624, basically, you could
argue this thing's like 30 40 times
overvalued. And it could be a massive
crash. And this could be really the the
signal that gets everyone panicking and
the selling. And it appeared all over
the market today. There's a bunch of
red. You can see Amazon, Tesla, Nvidia,
all of these were down. And Michael
Bur's again betting against Palunteer
and Nvidia. Warren Buffett is also
selling stocks six billion off the
table. We talked about before Buffett
sitting on a record pile of cash. So
he's on the sidelines, right? And then
you got Elon Musk, a billionaire,
begging to be a trillionaire. He's like,
"Oh, I just need that trillion. Don't
you want a world trillionaire that you
can worship?" Maybe. And um you know
while the billionaires are crying uh the
government is shut down and people are
struggling right and we're looking at
now the longest government shutdown in
history. And so why this whole thing is
absolutely absurd is you got this
billionaire then crying on national TVs.
>> Palanteer because we were anti we called
uh we called a lot of things that are
kind of establishment views that often
are uh viewed as kind of being super
woke into question and every single
assumption of Palanteer. The people who
piled in uh to Palanteer were people
investing their own money often people
who are not in the investor class
non-experts and even till today the
experts sit on the sideline and say hey
this can't be true while the average
American who invested in Palanteer and
for the first time maybe arguably in
since World War II uh average Americans
got venture returns investing in
Palanteer. So you have this massive
divide uh between the average person who
evaluated themselves and the expert
class that still was working on
assumptions that have historically not
been true.
>> So essentially you have that guy telling
everyone, hey this is a massive bubble.
We've convinced all these people retail
investors to buy Palunteer stock and if
he convince enough of them to do it, the
stock goes up. Sure. But it's all based
on hype and that's why I wanted to show
you his own words. You don't see this
that often on TV to basically people
point out the bubble. Then these are the
headlines today. US stocks slide as
investors fret over high valuations for
AI companies. Essentially we're valuing
these companies like your Palunteers or
Nvidia or whatever to be, you know,
tripling their revenue and and earnings
every single year. But it's just not
going to happen like like you can't have
unlimited growth. And remember, a lot of
this is based on building all these data
centers to replace all of you, which
doesn't make any sense. And then you get
this news. This is also today. Companies
are firing. IBM cutting thousands of
jobs in the fourth quarter. And we've
have, you know, Walmart is firing. Uh
Amazon is firing. Target is firing. UPS
is firing. Uh the government again is
shut down. Stocks are selling off. Like
this is not a good look. You can you can
see it in the markets. Um and then you
got the president of United States, you
know, celebrating like its uh 1920s uh
Great Gatsby stuff. And that was right
before the market crash. I mean, all of
these signals is it just it's kind of
crazy how history works. You know, I
guess every hundred years we have this
massive crash. Uh stock bulls get wakeup
call from Wall Street CEOs, market rap.
And that was all about how around Wall
Street, they're all starting to call
each other and say, "Hey, it's a bubble.
Hey, it's a bubble. It's a bubble." And
people are getting out.
>> Clearly, you know, you look at the
analysts, most analysts, you know, think
that this stock is overpriced. You have
people like Michael Bur out there
shorting it. Everybody who's shorted
this stock thus far has been on the
losing end of it. And I'm trying to
understand just from if you look at sort
of the growth trajectory, the sales, how
much of the sales frankly I think
actually even coming there was a huge
part coming from even existing customers
and just what the scale of this thing
ultimately looks like in your mind.
>> Okay, there are two parts. You know, of
course, when I hear short sellers
attacking uh what I believe is clearly
the most important software company in
America and therefore in the world in
terms of our impact simply to make money
and calling trying to call the AI
revolution into question where we have
these this anomalous numbers 114, rule
of 40, etc. It just is super triggering
because these people they could pick on
any company in the world. They have to
pick on the one that actually helps
people that actually has made money for
the average person that that is actually
supporting our war fighters. Why do they
have to go after us? And I'll tell you
what though, it's crazy motivating
because I'll tell you why the short
sellers are constantly getting screwed
by Palanteer. Because every time they
short us, we just are like tripling down
on getting the better numbers and part
honestly to make them poor.
>> To make them poor. But guys, this is
what a bubble looks like when you got,
you know, again, billionaire crying on
national TV, uh, trying to make the
case, oh, average Americans benefit from
my company. We're all making money.
Everything's going great. It's a bubble.
Michael Bur, this is what he was
tweeting out. Basically, he's showing
here how the growth isn't nearly what it
was hyped up to be. He's showing uh
cloud growth in the past and cloud
growth now. So, basically, it's slowing.
There's only so much of these data
centers that you need. That's basically
what it boils down to. That's why we've
been talking about the data center thing
uh recently and and everyone's been uh
tweeting out this chart uh also as of
late. This was from Bloomberg.
Basically, you're looking at circular
financing among a lot of these AI
companies. And we're going to look back
in history and we're like, "Yep, that
was definitely a bubble." If you don't
know what this means, essentially you
got a big company uh invest in a smaller
company and then that smaller company
then buys products from the big company.
Then they invest in each other and then
they all borrow money to again keep the
bubble going. That that's basically what
it boils down to. circular financing and
Michael Bur's been quoting books talking
about, you know, other previous bubbles.
Um, this is also what's been happening
as well. Uh, the president's kids,
right? How two tiny banks are helping
Trump's sons build a crypto empire. It's
obviously it's a bubble. It's obviously
a bubble. And the question's always
been, you know, how long can this thing
last? And that's why it's funny to
actually see the billionaire CEO get
called out and then watch him panic.
Watch some more. Now, you could argue, I
don't know, like they're constantly
like, but they they thought Panaltier
was overvalued at 10. They thought it
was overvalued at 20. I'm not even here
saying what the valuation is, and you
figure out the value, but they're in the
business of being skeptical and being
wrong, and we're in the business of
giving an unfair advantage to American
workers, American war fighters, and our
investors.
>> And so, while the tech is crying, you
also got this. Bitcoin falls below
100,000 as riskoff mood weighs on
crypto. So now people are getting out of
their doggy coins and monkey coins etc.
And it was funny because true story
about uh two weeks ago my wife's dad was
asking about crypto which he never talks
about this stuff at all. Like like never
would ever talk about crypto. It's
because it was kind of being hyped up on
the news. And as you always say when a
bubble's basically at the top if you're
your you know taxi driver, your Uber
driver, right? your your hairdresser,
your shoe shiner starts talking about,
hey, we should, you know, buy doggy
coins in crypto. That's the top. I'm
telling you, that's the top. And it's
not only that. Not only my wife's dad is
is talking about crypto. Uh, it it was
even mentioned on South Park this week.
If you guys saw the recent episode, they
were talking about crypto pump and dumps
and actually talking about corruption in
the White House. I mean, this is all
looking that way. You're looking at
outflows. I'm showing you a chart here
on crypto. Uh, Bitcoin. Actually, I was
wrong. It's not 15% down on the month.
It's 17% down on the month and then you
got tech billionaire CEOs crying on TV.
>> Being short is is a very difficult place
to be because you can lose everything,
right? You can drive these people into
the ground. Michael Bur put a really big
bet on. It's almost a billion dollars.
It's $912 million. That's a big step for
him to put into that. What when you say
you redouble your efforts, what do you
do? What do you go back in?
>> Um well, first of all, he's it's like
he's actually putting a short on AI. So
the way I read it was us and Nvidia and
it's like
>> the biggest position is you though. I
just threw all the shorts.
>> Okay. So and and then by the way with
the shorts is very complex. It's not
even clear that I honestly I think what
is going on here is market manipulation.
We delivered the best results everyone
anyone's ever seen. It's not even clear
he's not doing this to get out of his
position. I mean these people they claim
to be ethical but you know like they're
they're actually shorting one of the
great businesses of the world. And I'm
not against shorting as a matter of
theory, but I'm just saying pick
something that is not doing a noble
task.
>> And it's funny because for the average
person, you probably have no idea what
Palunteer is. And let me read a
description here. Palunteer, which was
founded in 2003, so it's not a new
company. It's right 2003 by Karp. That's
a guy that been watching cry. And Peter
Teal, the guy who claims he's the expert
on the Antichrist, and he's also linked
to Elon Musk. They just made fun of him
recently on South Park. This these are
all connected. and others sells AI
software to businesses and governments
around the world. It is technology is
used to collate analyze data from supply
chain an analysts to surveillance of
military targets and identification for
systems for undocumented migrants. So
there's been a rod of rumors out there
that that Trumpers are are using this
technology to run their ICE stuff. I
mean this is all a bubble and this is
Peter Teal who some people really love.
He's like this right-wing um campaign
financer kind of person. I best way to
describe it. And again, they were making
fun of him recently and they they had
the song Peter Teal knows about the
Antichrist. And if you saw it, you're
like, "What the heck?" They were really
talking about Peter Teal and the
Antichrist. And uh this is also where
we're at. And then you've got this this
famous method of vowing stocks is
pointing towards some rough years ahead.
And what they're referring to is the
Schiller PE ratio, which is basically
just for inflation. Look at the price of
stocks compared to how much companies
earn as a market as a whole. And you got
a really high read of 40, right?
Basically, you're overpaying for stocks.
You're paying a high price compared to
how much money they actually make. And
this AI stuff is all a massive bubble.
So, that's what's going on. I'd like to
hear your thoughts and I catch you on
the next
