## Transcript

This is GMK Tech Evo X2 and it looks
like a pretty regular mini PC except
it's far from a regular mini PC. It's
probably the best mini PC this year, the
most surprising CPU and I have been
waiting for 9 10 months to actually get
hands of this particular configuration.
If you don't know what I'm talking
about, this is the Ryzen AI 9395
plus max CPU and it's got 128 GB of
VRAM. And if you think this is
impressive, I've got a little surprise
for you in the end of the video. There
might be something even better than
that. Let's take a look. So, just a
quick recap of what you should be
expecting. We're going to take a look at
the device. I've run through all of the
benchmarks of this so we actually can
measure where does the CPU line up with
some of the other CPUs GPUs. I'm doing
an LLM test and we're going to tear it
apart to see what's inside. If there's
any upgrades, what's it actually made
of? This is the device. This is how it's
supposed to be oriented. So, you kind of
It's got feet on the bottom. There we
go. It blows air out from the back. I
think this is the intake from the side
here. Perhaps from this side in this
side as well and from there or it just
maybe I don't know if it's two chamber
one. We'll have to look at it up to see
what's that in the front here. Very
interestingly we've got an SD card slot
and if you're a creator you got to see
some of the benchmarks but this is also
amazing. Full-size SD card slot on this
mini PC. I am loving it. I think this is
the first mini PC from GMK Tech that
they've put the SD card reader in. If
you know GeekCom, Geekcom's put them
everywhere. Minis forum. We've seen on
some of them, but I haven't seen this on
GMK tech on any of the other ones. Power
mode. So, if you want to adjust the
power mode for your CPU, there's three
kind of low, mid, and high range. You
can do that through there. I've tested
it on power. USB 4, two USB type A's,
headphone, and mic combo jack. Power on.
And then on the side, you've got a fan
mode. So, if you want to adjust the fan
on the side there, Ryzen AI Max Plus.
Okay, there it is. It's golden. Do you
know how rare it is to get one of those?
And if you're watching this and you want
to pick one of these up, GMK actually
sent me one of their discount codes that
they're running right now. So, if you
want to check this out, I'm going to
leave the link in the description below.
You should be getting a discount from
there. I'll just paste it into there so
you can check it out. So, in the back of
the device, we have Kensington lock
power in another headphone and my combo
check if you wanted. It says here for
fastest setup avoid connecting LAN
initially. Connecting might trigger long
updates delaying desktop access. So
that's what I did. Don't do that. So
underneath here we've got 2.5 GB LAN USB
type A, another USB 4 display and HDMI
port and then two USB typeA ports. It
also comes with a power brick. The power
brick is external and I can see from
here it is 230
watt. Now, benchmarks then because that
is the amazing thing. Ryzen 395 plus
max. How good is it? Cinebench R24. So,
we're testing CPU first. This is 16
cores and 32 threads. So, take a look at
this. The Ryzen 7950X
3D. So, this is a desktop CPU. Is about
4% faster in the single core score and
about 7% faster in the multi-core score.
We are so close to the 7950X.
It's insane. The 3900K is about 14%
faster in the single core scores and 3%
slower in the multi-core scores. This is
faster than 3900K. And if you look at
the 9900X desktop CPU, 16.5% faster in
the single core scores. Interestingly,
the single core is not quite impressive
in there, but 4% slower in the
multi-core scores. This is faster in the
multi-core scores than the 9900X
on desktop. That's absolutely bonkers.
So, Geekbench 6, the same CPUs. We see
the 7950X is slightly more faster now.
4% in single and 12.9% in the multi-core
scores. 3900K about 6.5% faster in the
single core scores. So, not as much now,
but 22% faster in the multi-core scores.
9900X 16.2 and 16.9% faster in the
single and multi-core scores. So still,
I did not know what to expect, but to
have that power in a mini PC, I hope you
understand how ridiculous that is. It's
really, really amazing. But what about
the GPU? Because this is an SOC, so
there is CPU and GPU on all one chip.
And then the RAM is attached to it as
well. That's why you can have the VRAM
128 GB. Well, not exactly 128 GB. You
can have it 96 GB. So, if you want 96 GB
of VRAM, you have to pay like five
figures for a GPU. Do you understand how
ridiculous that is? Unless you go with
Apple, but we'll test that as well. So,
the M4 Max 40 core, if you want to get
it on Mac Studio or MacBook Pro, the
Open CL score is 12.7% faster. That is
probably the world's best integrated CPU
if we don't consider Apple. So, Intel
AMD, that's just the best one. Uh,
looking at the desktop, AR A750 is 1%
faster in the Open CL and about 5%
faster in the Vulcan scores. That GPU
pulls a lot more power than this here
and it's got a dedicated big massive
chip. This is all in there integrated.
The RTX 5050 is about 8% slower in Open
CL and 2% slower in the Vulcan scores
and that is desktop variant, not a
laptop variant, desktop variant. whereas
this is a laptop one. So if you see a
laptop with this in, it's quite
impressive. The AI benchmarks, I was
just picking some of the benchmarks out
so you kind of get a view of all of the
different things there. 285K, 50% faster
in single, 8% faster in half, but 3%
slower in quantise scores, which is
interesting. 9800 X3 the 5% slower in
single, 1% faster in half, and 22%
slower in quantized, which is quite
impressive. In terms of LLM test, we're
going to go to a different uh setup and
test how good this is on LLM. So,
welcome to the testing. I want to show
you the most amazing thing about this
and why this chip is so powerful, which
is the LLM's and AI use. So I want
visually to see what's happening here.
At the moment the memory is been split
50/50 in terms of system memory 64 and
then GPU 64 which is going to make a
very interesting thing here. So if I got
the CPU
here and then the GPU. Okay. So we've
got both of them. We can see what is
happening. We're going to load something
called Jack GPT OSS 20 billion
parameters which is 11.3 GB. Look at
that. Our GPU should start to utilize
this. For most GPUs that is quite hard
to use because it is 12 GB. So, you
know, you need to have 12 16 GB. Even 12
GB sometimes isn't enough. Obviously,
we've got lots of choices in here. Let
me see if it is. I'm just going to eject
this and I'm going to go back so we can
see GPU offload. Look, it just loads
everything on there. So, we're going to
load it. It should all go onto our GPU.
We should visually see that.
Interesting. It does use system memory.
But perhaps task manager is showing the
wrong which one is GPU, which one is
CPU. So, we say
we're giving it something to do. And
then interestingly, look at that. It's
using the CPU right now to run this, not
the GPU. But at the same time, it might
not actually the task manager might be
giving us something weird because we're
seeing we're using 83 what's on the GPU.
It shows the same on the CPU, but there
we go. 19.1 tokens per second and only
0.96 tokens till the first uh token
there. But now let's load this 126
billion parameters. So GPU offload will
try to get everything onto the GPU.
Let's take a look here. Our SSD is in
use as well. And memory it should be
able to load everything onto the GPU
because that model is like 60 59 60
something GB in size. So as you can see
it tries to load everything onto the
GPU. That's why our SSD is in use as
well. It's writing on it. So, let's see
if it can load everything onto the
memory. Oh, it's trying. Look at our
system memory. Look at the RAM usage.
It's literally 100%. Okay, that's it.
It's loaded.
Let me try this.
This is crazy large model. Crazy large
model. I'm not sure if it actually
utilized everything on the GPU, so we'll
see. Wow, look at that. Super hot. 97°
cuz it's trying to do all this work.
Interesting. Not all of the CPU seems to
be in use. Now, I have a feeling that
even though we had it 64 GB set for GPU,
64 GB for the actual RAM, the thing is
it probably leaves some kind of
reservation and because the GPT
120 billion parameter model is so large,
it might not just fit into there. So,
it's going to split it between GPU and
CPU. 82 watts CPU, 82 watts GPU,
mainstream consumer tech, single voice.
Well, am I single voice?
Entrepreneurship, personal finance,
lifestyle lessons. Alex, are you seeing
this? What's he talking about? Lifestyle
lessons. Let's see. Tech centering
personal development. Uh, it's
developer, not development. There's a
difference. Occasional tech reviews. The
CPU is really hot. 98.5°,
but what's coming out is hardly warm.
Okay, this just feels really, really
slow. So, I'm going to stop it because I
can't actually. So, look at that. It was
like waited almost a minute till the
first one and 2.26 tokens per second.
So, what we're going to do is we're
going to restart this and go into the
BIOS. There we go. Okay. Power mode,
performance mode. That's interesting. So
this button actually changes this inside
the BIOS as you can see. But we want to
go memory configuration. Okay. RGPU
configuration. So what we're going to do
is we're going to have 96 GG
which basically should be that now
there's 96 GB on the GPU. Let's have a
look. Is there any core performance
boost enabled? Enabled. Yep. Okay. 96 GB
VRAMm for our GPU. If you actually want
to buy a dedicated GPU with that amount
of VRAM, you'd have to go to Apple and
buy the M4 Max or the M3 Ultra. M3 Ultra
supports up to 512 GB of RAM. M4 Max 128
GB. I've got a MacBook here, that one
that has 128 GB. So, this costs $5,000.
this MacBook if I want to get similar
RAM. This one over here half the price.
That's why this is impressive. So, let's
have a look what's our task manager
saying now. Interestingly, look at that.
Our memory now on task manager is 32 GB,
which kind of lines up what we just did.
The GPU has got 96 GB of dedicated GPU
memory. So, we're going to open that up
again. Let's see if this goes any
better. So, we're going to load the same
model. 120 billion parameters. GPU
offload. Yep. Look, it wants to do all
of them cuz it knows it's got the VRAMm
GPU 61. So, let's just load it onto
there. Let's see if it does it any
faster. Okay, it's loading everything
off it. So, it's reading from the SSD.
For some reason, it doesn't exactly show
that any of the dedicated GPU memory is
utilized. It doesn't really show memory
usage there either. We'll see. Look
what's the bottleneck in our system
right here. The SSD can't
load fast enough. 64 GB
or something like that onto the GPU.
Looks like now we're actually power
limited by CPU. Only 80 W for some
reason in there and 80 W to the GPU. So,
it's kind of splitting the power because
we know that the GPU can go higher and
so can the CPU. But, I guess it's the
middle ground where it's trying to hit.
Okay.
We've got it ready. It's still using
system memory, not GPU memory. It's a
bit slow. I wonder if I did it the wrong
way. Let's just say that if you run AI
like this, you probably don't want to
run it locally.
But I could be doing something wrong as
well. The clock maker.
Oh my goodness. This is even worse. Stop
this thing. Okay. So, for some reason,
it wants all of it on CPU, not on GPU.
So, let's uh try it the other way.
Let's try that again. So, this time I'm
going to load this.
Okay, let's see if they can GPU offload
everything. Look at that. That loaded so
much faster. Interesting. Oh, look at
that. Oh, we're pulling 102 watts now.
See that memory 71.5 GB used. Please be
much faster than this. 75. Good news.
There we go. Thought for a brief moment.
It was kind of a brief moment. Magical
realism coming of age. It is spitting
out those like no tomorrow. So,
interestingly, even though I offloaded
everything to the GPU, it's still just
the way the system understands GPU and
CPU memory was vice versa, if that makes
sense. Look at these tokens now. Look
how it's spitting them out. Just
constantly pushing 82 W from the CPU
package power around 90 W CPU. It's not
actually that hot what comes out in
here. Look at that. 11.9 tokens per
second. What was that? The first time it
was two tokens per second. Now that was
five times faster. Something like that.
That's um interesting. But now if you
are a creator looking at creator
benchmarks, this is where things get
very interesting. But before they get
interesting, you might be also
interested in a Windows license, which
you can check out a little sketch in
here. Now,
it's so annoying. I don't want to pay
hundreds of dollars to just change my
Windows wallpaper just cuz my Windows
isn't licensed. Well, why don't you try
Hookies? That's a ton cheaper. And if
you use the Kot and 20, you get it even
cheaper.
What do you mean? How do I get it? And
how is it possible? Well, see this video
here or the one you're watching. Click
in the link on the video description.
Add the Windows 11 CD product to the
cart. Proceed to check out. Add the code
key in 20 for the extra discount. So,
what the Windows 11 Pro OEM key is just
$23.22.
Yeah. Choose the preferred payment
option and complete the purchase. The
key will be available on the purchased
orders in a few moments. Copy the key
and paste it into your Windows
activation settings and you're all done.
Well, that was easy. Is that Ryan
Gosling?
Uh uh no. Anyway, by the way, the same
discount code also works websitewide. So
go check out uh other products maybe
like Microsoft
Pujench for Photoshop. All of the
desktop CPUs are paired with an RTX 4090
desktop variant. Okay, the 9950X,
which is the best score that I have ever
got. So, this is the best Photoshop
score that I've ever got, is 3% faster
in overall, 2.5% slower in general, and
about 9% faster in filter scores. This
is quite impressive. Here's the thing.
Core Ultra 9 285K is about 10% slower in
overall scores, 16% slower in general
scores. And if you look at the 9800 X3D
is 1.5% faster in the overall scores,
but general score is about 4 4% slower
and about 7.8% slower in the filter
scores. This is an amazing machine for
Photoshop. If you want to do Photoshop
on it, you might not need anything else.
It's fantastic. Highly recommend. Links
in the description below with some of
the discount codes. Moving on to
Lightroom Classic. Again, all of the
desktop CPUs are paired with a desktop
4090. 9900X is about 5% faster in
overall scores. 285K about 40% faster.
The two 285K is the fastest score in
Lightroom Classic. So, Intel is faster
in Lightroom Classic. But the 9800X 3D
desk variant is about 12.8% faster in
overall scores. So, Lightroom Classic
not so impressive as Photoshop, but
regardless, the performance is
absolutely amazing with this Pug Bench
for Premiere Pro. And this is where I
had to test coming kind of some of the
two laptop variants here because if you
have an RTX 50490 it's going to give you
a lot more performance or if you have an
Intel chip for example that gives you a
lot of performance as well because of
Intel quicks sync. So what I wanted to
test is that M4 Max that costs a lot of
money more than twice as expensive as
this here. In terms of video editing the
M4 Max is a lot faster. It's getting
close to twice as fast. 57% standard
scores and about 72% in extended overall
scores. Uh intraframe score is more than
double in there. So that's not
impressive compared to a Mac if you want
video editing. But if you look at um
Asus Proad P16 with the RTX 4070 if you
remember that laptop on the channel
about 14% faster in the standard and
extended overall scores. Long GP score
though is faster on this than on there.
So, if you do an H.264 or five, this is
faster, which is pretty insane.
Obviously, you can see that the GPU
scores is faster on the Proad because of
the massive Nvidia GPU. But regardless,
I think for video editing, it's an okay
machine, especially if you're doing
H.264,
you can get away with this very, very
well. Looking at After Effects and here,
I was kind of struggling to finding like
what score is there. So this is 12900K
with Intel Arc B50 Pro CPU and you can
see that basically they perform roughly
about the same which is pretty
impressive considering this is all
system on chip all like in one little
section. Dome resolve this is 7800X 3D
with RTX 4090 bear that in mind desktop
4090. So the GPU gives huge amounts of
performance in Dinci Resolve can utilize
all of the CUDA RTX coursees, tensor
cores, everything. But in there the
overall basic score is about 8.7% uh
faster. The standard and extended scores
are 42 and 64% faster. Interestingly
long GOP score still faster than this
one. But now taking the same laptop, the
Asus Pro RP6 with RTX 4070 and look at
the scores now. basic score faster,
standard score faster, extended scores
faster. This is faster than that one
with RTX 4070, which is pretty insane.
And I did not want to believe that. So
that means that if you want to use Dinci
Resolve, the Ryzen AI Max is not a bad
CPU or GPU at all, what should we call
it, cuz it's all in one. Now 3D going to
Blender, the 9900X
desktop CPU is slower than this. 1% in
monster scene, 3% in junk shop scene and
9.8% slower in classroom scene. Core
ultra 7 is slightly faster in monster
scene, 2.8% about 5% slower in junk shop
scene and about 11.9%
slower in the classroom scene. M4 Max
CPU about 2.9%
or 2.8% 8% faster in monster scene, 1.3%
slower in junk scene, and about 20%
slower in classroom scene. This CPU for
3D rendering, hugely impressive. Super
impressed with that. The GPU rendering
uh in Blender wasn't really impressive
with this. If you know Nvidia, like
actual GPUs are so much better in there.
They can utilize optics and all of the
CUDA cores, artices. They're much
faster. So, I didn't even bother putting
it in because that went like very much
in the lower part of this and would
compete kind of like with some of the
desktop Intel CPUs. So, it's is not
impressive in terms of GPU rendering in
a blender. But V-Ray, for some reason,
it was able to do V-Ray in CUDA
benchmark scores, which should not
happen. And I don't know why this is
possible, but let's take a look. In
terms of CPU and Vray, this guy is
actually beating the 9900X. It's even
beating the 265K by 6.7%. Which is
pretty insane. And if you're looking at
the CUDA score, not the RTX score, then
the RTX 3050 is about 15.9%
slower. So having that type of GPU as an
iGPU, pretty impressive actually. Pretty
impressive. When talking about the power
draw, I tested all the different
settings. The most power it can pull on
GPU and CPU is 120 W. it might boost a
little bit more and then slots into the
120 W. That's where the CPU and GPU go
in there and that's why we get 230 W
power brick. It's kind of the sum of
both the CPU and GPU. Now, what I want
to know is um what's inside. So, I don't
see any screws. So, I'm going to have to
peel underneath these.
And there we go. They've kind of
going to wreck
the plast Oh yeah, all the glue is gone.
Okay, something is there. But basically
all the glue is gone.
Then it's going to peel open.
Whoa. Okay.
Okay. This side comes off easier.
All righty. So, we've got a big 120 mm
fan in here that just blows air on the
back of the CPU. Oh, that's cool. So
underneath here I can see another M.2
slot that you can just add extra SSD in
there if you wanted to. Okay. And this
side we can see the CPU cooling. Two
massive blower fans. Boom. And then a
huge heat sink on this side. And it
works pretty pretty well actually. The
cooling is all right in there. Let's
take a look if we can see what the heat
pipes and what's that going on
underneath.
I'm going to slice this so you don't
have to do that. We're just going to
Yeah, there we go.
So, basically that tape is there to make
sure that some of the air flow is not
coming up, but it's just guided through
all of this. And in terms of heat pipes,
there's a lot going on. One, two, three
heat pipes. And then they go onto the
heat sink. There are four screws that
take the heat sink off. Let's do it.
Okay, let's see if
There we go. The heat sink comes off.
And look at that. There's still some
kind of a sticker on the side, but here
we have thermal pad. Very nicely on all
of these MOSFETs. Power delivery.
There's one in there as well. These must
be like some chips that need power there
as well. So, they've put a massive
thermal pad in there. This is the Ryzen
AI 395 Plus Max chip and everyone is
raving about this. So, as you can see,
they are cooling the memory as well. So,
what you can see here is the CPU and the
GPU. They're all in this one die in
there. There's two side uh chips there
as well. I don't know if this is IO or
how exactly have they laid it. You can
clearly see two separate tiles. You can
see one smaller one, bigger one. And
well, actually they seem to be same size
and then one massive one there. And then
here on the side is the actual RAM. So I
don't know which manufacturer this is,
but there's one, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight. Eight. So, how much
is that each then? 16 GB each. Yeah. So,
each one of those chips is 16 GB and
then we can get 128 GB altogether. Now,
you don't actually need to tear it
apart, but I wanted to see that Ryzen AI
Max Plus chip. You can see it's on the
top in there. The serial number is
1,099.
Pretty cool.
Oh, there is a cool thing though. So,
this is an RGB fan and actually on this
side, can you see there's a GMK tech
that illuminates through and the same on
that side? Illuminates through from that
side. Terms of airflow, this fan is kind
of for just show, but you don't see any
of this because it's all underneath
there, but you only see the sides.
Here it is. It's all back together,
working like a charm. And remember, this
is the part of the video where you're
thinking, "Come on, what what's what's
even better with this?" Firstly, I'm
super impressed with that tiny little
thing. I think if you're looking for an
insane local LLM machine and just
something to do ingestion with because
you've got SD card reader, super fast
ports, super fast like anything
upg radeable in terms of SSD is
impressive. But after receiving this
one, I got another one.
This one here, which is the Minis Forum
S1 Max AI. This one also has 128 GB.
It's got some impressive things like
dual 10 GB Ethernet PCIe slot. So, if
you want to see this one, subscribe,
like, and uh soon we're going to go and
check this one out. Until then, thanks
guys for watching. Check out the links
for these in the video description
below. See you soon. Bye-bye.
